## Introduction
My entry for js13kgames 2023 is "Trench Fisher." But why the title, and what really inspired this entry? Well, when I first heard about the js13k games 2023 theme, "13th century," the first idea that popped into my mind was how my hometown, "Livingstone - Area 213," might have looked in the middle ages. That idea gave rise to Trench Fisher, a game inspired by the actual geographic landmarks of my hometown[^1].

## Development

Development of Trench Fisher began with the usual wireframing on a blank canvas, accompanied by notebook sketching, as I often do for most of the games I create. For the coding part, I was comfortably translating caffeine and my imagination into algorithms and data structures in raw JavaScript.

The following libraries were used in the development:

1. [linked-list](https://github.com/wooorm/linked-list)[^2]
2. [Kontra](https://github.com/straker/kontra)[^3]
3. [Zzfxm](https://github.com/keithclark/ZzFXM/)[^4]
4. Zzfxm samples: ["I'm Back"](https://keithclark.github.io/ZzFXM/tracker/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithclark/ZzFXM/master/examples/songs/iamback.js)[^5]
5. Kenney's "Tiny Battle" assets[^6]

The title screen was designed to resemble the classic J2ME games, such as Gameloft's "Gangster Crime City" (2009), with a vertical column containing a title and stacked menu items.

The world map was an idea I had from the beginning. It may be classic, but I love it that way. It simply shows locations joined by routes.

## Gameplay and Mechanics

The gameplay for the role-playing game Trench Fisher revolves around the idea of the player fishing in one of the eight levels, each representing a trench at Lake Kariba[^1]. It was honestly inspired by Electronic Arts' The Sims 3 franchise (2008).
